## Best Practices

1. **Be intellectually honest** - Acknowledge weaknesses in bear case
2. **Use specific evidence** - Cite concrete data, not vague pessimism
3. **Consider timing** - Even good bear thesis can be early
4. **Historical context** - Compare to previous bear cycles
5. **Update thesis regularly** - Bear case evolves with new data
6. **Avoid confirmation bias** - Seek evidence that challenges your view
7. **Quantify risks** - Estimate magnitude of downside
8. **Don't be permabear** - Be willing to flip bullish when data changes
